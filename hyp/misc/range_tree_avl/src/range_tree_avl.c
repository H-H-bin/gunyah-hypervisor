// This is an implementation of range_tree using an AVL tree.
//
// We pick AVL trees over other balanced trees such as RB or WAVL because our
// use cases are read-mostly, rarely updated. AVL trees are more strictly
// balanced, and thus have faster lookups, but have extra storage cost and may
// require more rotations for a single update.
//
// Note that we don't allow ranges to overlap within the tree; lookups always
// return the single range containing the base address, if one exists. Therefore
// a naïve binary tree is sufficient; we don't need an augmented interval tree.
